Articulations will be made as to put you in my shoes. This project has a lot more history beyond its Jpeg state.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            It's 2014-2016, Trump has just been elected into office. The political and social state of the world is going crazy. Riots are breaking out resulting in anarchy across many of America's largest cities. People are letting out there inner rage, their anger, there hate.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Then there is me, too young to comprehend what is going on. But little did I know what I was doing was no different than what the rioters were doing, as I too was letting out hate, pain, and anger, desperate to express myself but still too young to hold any knowledge or understanding of human psychology.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I was confused, looking for answers. Although I was young, I always tried to decipher social/psychological situations in order to find a conclusion or reason why. The only vent I could find was through my colored pencils and my sketchbook, which is where I placed everything. Little did I know where it would eventually lead.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I would continue to burn through sketchbooks weekly. Before I knew it months were going by. The drawing never stopped. many things were drawn, motivated to expand upon my artistic ability. One of the things I began drawing was a face. A face that could look any sort of way with the adjustment of my pencil. Something that could act as a reflection of my current emotions at that moment.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            That face became one of my favorite pieces. Possibilities regarding its expressions and visible emotions seemed endless.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Little did one know all of the adventures/situations/scenarios art would lead me to have and engage in. Which as of right now, is an NFT project/videogame of all things. Which brings us toooo……….\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_PROFILE_PICS} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I have been drawing these faces for years as a form of expression and thought I would try out commissions. Pretty much this is where someone pays you money to make something for pretty much any artistic medium and in my case, it was these faces/skulls… whatever you’d like to call them. I would get commissions that would cost the buyer around $30-$50 depending on how long it took.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            This is really where the project began. My profile picture sales steadily increased and people really liked them, a lot. There were a few comments on my seller's thread that I should start making NFT’s. At first, I thought to myself “NFT’s are fucking stupid why would I do that” I also had ZERRROOO idea on how to make them and the never-ending errors and fuck ups that would soon come.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_ORIGINAL_60} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The original 60 was original my first scheduled drop. The original 60 were all individually drawn, (not assets from folders) NFTs. That I had either taken from commissions or drawn individually and planned to do a release on OpenSea a few months ago. The idea behind this drop was to release a very small amount of NFTS, which did correlate with my marketing budget at the time, (which was very low, only $3,000), and hopefully sell a few and maybe start building a name/brand.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The original strategy was to differ from the HUGE NFT drops with 10,000+ and hopefully due to the fact that we are different, attract an audience, which waaaas actually what was happening. At the time we were gonna drop we had around 400 people in the discord which may not seem like a lot, but the ratio to user/buyers was very healthy. I had already around $6,000 in confirmed buyers and had only used up $600 of our budget on our very small marketing campaign.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            You are probably wondering what happened to this NFT drop. You may be wondering: “Hexado! Where are these NFT’s? Did you even release them???” The answer is no. We did not actually go through with the NFT drop. Our reasoning for this was extremely important and I am soooooo happy we didn't.\r\n                            This brings us into stage two\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_AGUILAM} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Aguila Media. What an interesting chapter of the project. This was really the first time we were considering “going big”. We first were contacted by this marketing company through a discord DM, as many people were trying to sell us their services due to our small marketing campaign. Aguila Media was one of them. However, there was one thing that made them stand which was their professionalism as well as their contacts and links to certain people that would be beneficial to helping the project.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I was on many calls with the main salesmen of Aguila Media and it really showed me the NFT space from a professional perspective. In the end, we didn't end up doing business with them for a few reasons.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The first reason would be, that their prices were WAY too high when looked at proportional to the services they were offering. We could do a lot of what they would have done for us on our own and still save a ton of money left over as one of the agreements were they would get 5% of the initial mint. And the second reason: their contract was HORRIBLE. There were mismatched text and coloring issues.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            There were also really weird warning labels everywhere which were extremely unnerving considering we were about to send them $25,000 upfront and would have been sending upwards of $20,000 for the extra advertising which they WOULD NOT have included which was stupid. They also failed to provide any visual evidence of past projects they have worked with. There was a lot of “we did this and worked with them” but nothing to back it up.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Overall I don't know what the outcome would have been if we did end up going with them but I'm happy we didn't because there are better options out there.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_KELLY} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Sean Kelly. The king of deception? Lies, scams, and scandals? The “Sean Kelly” chapter of this project was a crazy one. I never would have thought I would end up dealing with people like Sean Kelly and his team.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            I would say that the “Sean Kelly” phase of this project was one where this project certainly matured the most. The amount I learned during this phase of the project was an amount that could be considered a “fuck ton”. There were few times when I (directly) had contact with Mr. Kelly, for the most part, I was talking to one of his marketers/salesmen who went by “Marshall”. My experience with Marshall was one that could be considered far beyond exceptional. Marshall taught me an extremely large amount about the NFT space and would always respond to my questions with clear, correct answers. Marshall was on top of his shit\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Marshall was the one who originally brought the idea to me of releasing smaller quantities as opposed to a 10,000 piece drop all at once. We had had dozens of calls with Marshall discussing the services he planned to deliver. In the end, we were met with disappointment when we found out about past experiences with Sean Kelly and his team.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            We are not going to say Sean Kelly’s team is one consisting of scammers as we do not want to get fucking flamed due to the fact Sean Kelly does hold a threatening amount of “internet power”. There was also proof of semi-positive experiences with their team and they did have plenty of powerful projects listed on their website that they had “worked” with in the past.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            These allegations were first brought to my attention when we were actually getting the CONTRACT WRITTEN for Mr. Kelly. My friend Aiden sent me a link to another project's discord where they had actual evidence of Sean Kelly's team not delivering their services and running off with $25,000.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            It would be one thing if it was just hear-say-they-say but there was evidence and that was enough for our team to call off the contract and cancel the transaction of funds. Also if you go to his Instagram there are also people accusing him of stealing money in the comments of his insta so lol that too.  This period was probably the most stressful and emotionally breaking due to the fact our marketing plan was pretty much nonexistent and we were continuously being disappointed by sketchy folk…..\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_FIRST_GEN} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Our first prototype for the generative drops was first experimented with awhile back. It was actually right after I finished making the original 60 drop.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            The VERY FIRST guy I started working with was named Remix. Remix was the first developer who constructed the program that put together the NFTS. It was an extremely grueling process and the amount of trail/error was absolutely insane. It was one of the most stressful periods of time I have ever put up with.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            By the end I believe the program had around 2,000 lines of code. It was ran through notepad and there were a few key parts missing so even if we did want to release, it would have been a massive mess. The first mistake is we had ZERO METADATA.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Now the grammar I have used in the text above is mostly past tense for the reason that Remix abandoned the project. Remix got very lazy and would rather smoke weed and listen to Babytron and King Von than actually advance with the project.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Remix basically discontinued working on the project after saying “Man, I dont really see the point of all of this money shit, its all made up” He refused to give me the current program that put together the NFTS and refused to let me buy it off of him which confuses me to this day. I basically had to start from round 0. No program. No dev. Nothing.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_COLIN_LETTER} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Yes!.. Colin!!! Colin is one of the only honest people I have met in the NFT space. How I came into contact with Colin is actually quite funny. I was asking mods of the alleged “scammed” discord and Colin aka IRL was one of the moderators I ended up messaging (I really wanted the full story from all perspectives before coming to a conclusion). While messaging back and forth with Colin, he proposed that he was also taking on smaller NFT projects and helping them grow similar to other services. Colin knows people for pretty much anything (metadata is something we still needed to be generated) so we started talking and we really vibed. We had similar opinions and after a long, long discussion on the services he would provide and sources backing him up.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            After complete clarity of what he would provide we decided to go with him as my marketer/ networker/ manager type guy. He has answered hundreds of questions and this project certainly wouldn't be where it is today without his participation in its evolution and character development.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_WEB_DESIGN} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Fitz was our web developer. Fitz was originally introduced to me by Colin and in the beginning, he was great! Fitz is the one who actually made the custom program that put together the NFTS. Most devs couldn’t due to the complexity regarding the background colors/fills//overlays/dominating layers/etc. He also implemented the asset rarity as well as the metadata is rust (for sol)\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Fitz also designed the site! He did a pretty good job formatting it as well as picking the dark purple color scheme. Great job fitz! But there's one problem, it's been around 3 months with no response from fitz?! Meaning…. We don't have access to the site that I already PAID FOR. Fitz never gave me the source code or Figma file before he decided to vanish. However, we do have access to the domain. Good news though, as of recently we found another dev that seems to be a lot better for our web design.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_VIDEO_GAME} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            A videogame going hand-in-hand with our project was something I wanted to do from close to the beginning but is something that wasn't executed until recently (last 1-2 months). Funny enough I have known the dev Karl whos working on the videogame for around 6 months by now but have just recently began working with him.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            On my search to find resources for the videogame I found JV in a discord server. Hes working on the levels/media/VFX and has so far been doing a great job. Everythings been going pretty well.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Honestly, I am so happy we are going with a videogame. So many NFT project videogames are hot piles of shit so the opportunity to make one that's cool and innovative is still new/rare. Not to mention the entire new demographic and marketing space it opens up. Overall it makes the project 100x cooler than a project without a videogame.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Sure it will cost a lot more to make than if it was just an NFT project as you have to factor in the costs regarding frontend, backend, sound manipulation, UI, level design, and so on. In the end, it will be worth it due to the fact it's not only cool, but it will be financially rewarding as well when executed properly.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_NGU_LETTER} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            On the quest through many, many discord servers, I eventually found NGU. NGU is Fit’s replacement. NGU has been handling the backend/frontend of the website and will most likely be handling any smart-contracts that are needed in the future. NGU is the newest addition to the team. He is also the only team member from Japan which is pretty unique.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                    <Column alignItems=\"center\">\r\n                        <HEXADOImage src={HEXADO_END} className=\"hexado-journey-img\" />\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            As you can see, this project has gone through many stages of development and has come a long way from its beginning. Our team will continue to work hard and by the time you're reading this, we have most likely begun marketing!!! Exciting!!! Who knows where this will take us next?? Well.. we actually do because we have a roadmap lol.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </Column>\r\n                </Column>\r\n            </Container>\r\n        </Wrapper>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Wrapper = styled.section`\r\n    background-color: #03031B;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n    justify-content: center;\r\n    padding: 120px 20px;\r\n    .hexado-journey-mark{\r\n        max-width: 850px;\r\n        margin-bottom: 80px;\r\n    }\r\n    .hexado-journey-img{\r\n        padding-bottom: 15px;\r\n    }\r\n    .hexado-journey-content {\r\n        gap: 30px;\r\n    }\r\n    p{\r\n        color: white;\r\n        font-family: Open Sans;\r\n        line-height: 32px;\r\n        font-size: 20px;\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        max-width: 1300px;\r\n    }\r\n`"],"names":["HEXADO_JOURNEY_MARK","SharedImage","HEXADO_WHY_BACK","HEXADO_PROFILE_PICS","HEXADO_ORIGINAL_60","HEXADO_AGUILAM","HEXADO_KELLY","HEXADO_COLIN_LETTER","HEXADO_WEB_DESIGN","HEXADO_VIDEO_GAME","HEXADO_NGU_LETTER","HEXADO_END","HEXADO_FIRST_GEN","JourneyPage","Wrapper","justifyContent","src","className","alignItems","styled"],"sourceRoot":""}
